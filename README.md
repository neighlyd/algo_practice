# Algorithms and misc. exercises

This is a directory where I program the various algorithms and practice exercises I do.

The [algorithm_course](algorithm_course) directory is the work stemming from the Practical Algorithms and Data Structures book by Brad Miller and David Ranum found here:

The [daily_prog](daily_prog) folder contains various exercises that I have coded from [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer), which is a good source for exercises of various skill levels.

The [interview_questions](interview_questions) are exercises taken from across the web, including YouTube videos, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), and other places.

The [searches](searches) and [sorts](sorts) are taken alternatively from [Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein](https://smile.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844?sa-no-redirect=1), and [MIT's 6006](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm).
